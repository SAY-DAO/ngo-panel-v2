Therefore, the United Nations defined the UNCRC in 1989, which has been signed over by 196 countries and is being executed in 140 countries. This is, by far, the most complete statement of children's rights ever produced.\nThe United Nations Convention on the Right of the Child is mainly prepared, for governments but in our belief, the UNCRC must be edited and re-presented for all individuals of the society.\nBear in mind that SAY, just like the United Nations, abides and respects the laws and safety of any country it operates in.",

SAY matches every user with a specific child with similar personality traits. Users can read the child’s real-life story and also listen to their thoughts and dreams through their recorded voices.\nUsers can adopt and improve the quality of life of specific children by taking care of all their daily, educational and developmental needs through well-known and trusted online retailers over a transparent platform by microdonations from their phones. Moreover, SAY creates a unique avatar on behalf of every single child to protect children's rights and abide by the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\nIn addition, the SAY App is a solution to 5 of United Nations’ SDGs and increases the donation rate by taking the “identifiable victim effect” into account. According to research, people are willing to expend greater resources to save the lives of identified victims than to save equal numbers of unidentified or statistical victims."
